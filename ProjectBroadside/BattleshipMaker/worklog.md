# Worklog

## May 27, 2025

- Integrated the initial steps of the 3D model generation framework from `ProposedChange.md` into `src/main.py`.
- Modified `process_single_image` to collect Gemini analysis results for different views of the same ship.
- Added `apply_3d_framework_steps_for_ship` function to handle ship-specific 3D processing steps.
- Implemented the scaling and alignment logic (Step 3) based on transcribed dimensions and hull bounding boxes.
- Added conceptual placeholders for subsequent 3D generation steps (Hull Contour Extraction, Component Primitive Generation, Hull Construction, Assembly, Final Review, Export).

## May 27, 2025

- Implemented the conversion of vectorized hull contours from pixels to meters (part of Step 4) in `apply_3d_framework_steps_for_ship`.
- Began implementing Component Primitive Generation (Step 5) by calculating approximate 3D dimensions and center positions in meters for components based on Gemini's bounding box data and calculated scale factors.

## May 27, 2025

- Integrated `trimesh` and `shapely` libraries and added import error handling.
- Extracted hull contours and converted points to meters (completing Step 4).
- Calculated approximate 3D dimensions and center positions for components.
- Generated basic box primitives for components using `trimesh` (completing Step 5 - primitive generation).
- Added a placeholder for hull construction using contour extents to create a bounding box.
- Added basic assembly and export steps using `trimesh`.

## May 27, 2025

- Added logic to generate conceptual 2D cross-sections (Y-Z profiles) for hull construction based on the vectorized hull contours in meters.
- Added a placeholder for the `trimesh` lofting/skinning implementation (part of Step 6).

## May 27, 2025

- Refined cross-section generation for hull construction using `shapely` to find intersection points.
- Converted cross-section points to `trimesh.Path2D` objects and prepared input for `trimesh.creation.skin_sections`.
- Added an attempt to use `trimesh.creation.skin_sections` for hull lofting (part of Step 6).

## Next Steps

- **May 27, 2025:** Run the script with sample image data to test the implemented hull construction (Step 6). Analyze logs for errors and inspect the generated 3D hull mesh. Based on the results, refine the cross-section generation or lofting logic as needed.
