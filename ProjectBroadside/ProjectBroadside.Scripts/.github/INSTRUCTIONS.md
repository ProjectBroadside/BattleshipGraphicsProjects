# Project Broadside - GitHub Instructions

## Getting Started with Serena MCP Server

Welcome to Project Broadside! This project uses the Serena MCP (Model Context Protocol) server for enhanced AI-assisted development.

### First Time Setup

When you start a new chat session with an AI assistant in this repository, **always begin by asking for the initial project instructions**:

```
Please provide the initial instructions for this project using the Serena MCP server.
```

This will:
- Load the project-specific context and configuration
- Set up the proper working environment
- Provide you with relevant project documentation and guidelines
- Configure the AI assistant with project-specific knowledge

### Why This Matters

The Serena MCP server maintains:
- Project-specific memories and context
- Code structure understanding
- Development workflows and best practices
- Integration patterns and architectural decisions

Without loading these initial instructions, the AI assistant won't have access to the full project context and may provide less accurate or relevant assistance.

### Project Overview

Project Broadside is a naval combat simulation game built in Unity, featuring:
- ECS (Entity Component System) architecture
- Complex AI command and formation systems
- Realistic naval physics and combat mechanics
- Hierarchical command structures (Fleet → Squadron → Division → Ship)

### Key Directories

- **`Authoring/`** - MonoBehaviour authoring components for ECS conversion
- **`Components/`** - ECS component definitions
- **`Systems/`** - ECS system implementations
- **`Core/`** - Core game systems and utilities
- **`Dependencies/`** - External dependencies and integrations
- **`.Documentation/`** - Project documentation and design documents

### Development Workflow

1. **Start every new chat session** by requesting initial instructions from Serena MCP
2. Use Serena's symbolic editing tools for code modifications
3. Leverage the project's memory system for context-aware development
4. Follow the established ECS patterns and architectural guidelines

### Need Help?

If you're unsure about any aspect of the project or encounter issues:
1. Ask Serena MCP for relevant documentation
2. Check the `.Documentation/` folder for design documents
3. Use Serena's search capabilities to find similar patterns in the codebase

Remember: **Always start with requesting the initial instructions from Serena MCP!**
