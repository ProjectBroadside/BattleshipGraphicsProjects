Current session summary:

**Ongoing Task:** Executing the integration plan from `Project_Broadside_Analysis_2025-06-29.md`.
  - **Part 1 (Codebase Refactoring):** Completed staging of code files. Noted one file (`BuoyancySystem.cs`) was not found.
  - **Part 2 (Documentation Migration):** Created new documentation directory structure. Currently attempting to move existing markdown files to the `Archive` directory within `.Documentation/`. Encountered issues with `move_many_files.py` due to JSON parsing from shell arguments, and am now attempting to resolve this by passing JSON via a temporary file.

**Immediate New Goal:** Refactor the user authentication module.
